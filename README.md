# data_cleaning_U.S_census

Practicing to pull and clean data from the web using Python and visualizing for analysis.

Plan of action:

Create and outcome of scatterplots and histograms by the end of the day with the presented data, into pandas and into a reasonable shape so that I can make these histograms for an analysis?
