# data_cleaning_U.S_census
Practicing to pull and clean data from the web using Python and visualizing for analysis.

Filling in the shoe of a Data Analyst at the Census Bureau, collects census data, and creates interesting visualizations and insights from it.

We have gathered all the data from the most recent census in multiple csv files. Pandas was not used - they would just look through these csv files manually whenever they wanted to find something. Sometimes a copy and paste strategy was used with certain numbers into Excel to make charts.

This is not scalable or repeatable.

The plan:

Create and outcome of scatterplots and histograms by the end of the day with the presented data, into pandas and into a reasonable shape so that I can make these histograms for an analysis?
